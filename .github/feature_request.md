If you are part of Gnosis Safe Team:

1. Talk to @Uxio0 about the feasibility
2. Create an issue on the proper repo describing
   - What is needed?
   - Why is it needed?
   - When is it needed?
3. Bring it up on Slack in the safe-team chat so we can discuss priority and details.
4. Possibly ad-hoc meetings to discuss the feature.
5. Depending on priority, the backend will immediately tackle it or later on.
